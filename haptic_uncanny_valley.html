                    <p>In the field of human-robot interaction, one approach to enhance people’s acceptance of robots is to increase a robot’s familiarity by using anthropomorphic(human-like) design. However, Mashiro Mori (1970) proposed a theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley">“The Uncanny Valley”</a> that as a robot increases human-likeness, there is a point where the degree of robot's human-likeness and people's expectation becomes out of balance. This imbalance makes negative emotional response toward a robot. In the study, I assess how the anthropomorphic(human-like) robot design affects people’s acceptance toward a robot in the aspect of haptics.</p>

                    <p><b>Study Design</b><br />
                    Two types of experiments were conducted: Experiment I, in the context of touching a robot’s body, and Experiment II, in the context of viewing a robot’s body texture. I had 2 different participant groups for each experiment.</br>Participant experienced four robots with different skin textures. Those skin textures had different levels of anthropomorphism(human-likeness). After interacting with four robots, participants answered questionnaires regarding each stimulus.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Stimuli</b><br />
                    According to Shirado et al. (2006), smooth-roughness of surface texture and soft-hardness of material’s structure are influential factors on people’s perception of human-like skin texture. In addition, Georgious and Edwards (2014) insisted that roughness, which is related to the physical stiffness of a material, is one of the important persuasive cues for an object’s identity.

                    Based on these researches, four different textures of the robot surface were selected by roughness (smooth vs. rough) and stiffness (soft vs. hard): oil-based modeling clay (smooth-soft), plastic (smooth-hard), wiresponge (rough-soft) and stonespray (rough-hard).

                    <p>I created interactive prototypes using 3D printing and LittleBits with selected four types of robot surface. The robots made sound feedback when participants touched the robot's body. The robots were controlled by the Wizard of Oz technique.</p>

                    <p><b>Measure</b><br />
                    Social presence, anthropomorphism and animacy of a robot were measured to see how participants perceive human-likeness of robots. In addition, likability and perceived safety were measured to see whether participants feel comfortable with them or not.</p>
                   <p><b>Results</b><br />
                   In experiment 1, participants had haptic interactions with the four robots by physical contact. The results showed that low level of physical roughness and stiffness of robot surface enhanced the social presence of a robot. Participants perceived the highest level of social presence to the robot with smooth-soft texture (clay) and the lowest level of social presence to the robot with rough-hard texture (stonespray). However, they showed different tendency in likeability and perceived safety of a robot. Participants preferred the robot with smooth-hard texture (plastic) the most, followed by smooth-soft texture (clay).</p>

                    <p>The results of experiment 1 indicates that surface texture could be used as the way of regulating tactile anthropomorphism of a robot. The graphs above shows that smoothness(physical stiffness from material structure) made dominant impact than the roughness(perceived roughness from surface shape pattern).</p>
                    <center><span class="image main"><img src="images/haptic9.jpg" alt="", style="width:626px;height:330px;" /></span></center>
                    <p>The results from experiment I and II showed a significant difference between visual interaction and tactile interaction regarding likeability of a robot. Participants, who had haptic interaction with a robot in experiment 1, preferred hard surface than soft surface. On the contrary, participants, who had visual interaction without touch in experiment 2, preferred soft surface to hard surface.</p>
                    <center><span class="image main"><img src="images/haptic10.jpg" alt="", style="width:455px;height:435px;" /></span></center>
                    <p>These different user acceptances of a robot between haptic and visual interactions implies that haptic uncanny valley based on the multi-way interaction with vision and touch would have a different trend with Mori’s uncanny valley based on visual interction.</p>
                    <p>Through the experiment I and II, I demonstrated an example of modulating the level of tactile anthropomorphism of a robot by considering surface texture. The finding of this study can be an initial basis of designing acceptable social robot in haptic aspects.</p>
