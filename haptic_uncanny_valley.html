                    <p>As robots and humans share smaller spaces, robots have more intimate interactions with its users using haptic sense. In the field of human-robot interaction, one major approach to enhance people’s acceptance of robots is the attempt to increase a robot’s familiarity by using anthropomorphic (human-like) design. This includes robot’s humanlike appearance, facial expressions, and other social cues, as well as natural humanlike interaction (e.g. speech, gaze, gestures). However, the role of anthropomorphism in robotics is not to build an artificial human but rather to take advantage of it as a mechanism through which social interaction can be facilitated.</p>

                    <p>Mashiro Mori developed a theory of The Uncanny Valley, which states that as a robot increases in humanness there is a point where the robot is not 100% similar to humans but the balance between humanness and machine-likeness is uncomfortable.<br />Then how people perceive a humanlike robot in haptic interaction?</p>
                    <p>In most of haptic interaction, people use their haptic and visual perception sense together. First, When people watch an object, eyes receive the inputs in the form of light and have visual perception. Next, when people touch an object, skins detect an object and recreate tactile sense and force sense by applying force and friction. Tactile sense perceives surface texture, temperature, and friction by sensory receptors in human skins. Force sense receives information of stiffness, weight, and force by using one’s muscles and proprioception.</p>

                    <p>According to Shirado et al. (2006), smooth-roughness of surface texture and soft-hardness of material’s structure are influential factors on people’s perception of human-like skin texture. In addition, Georgious and Edwards (2014) also insisted that roughness, which is related to the physical stiffness of a material, is one of the important persuasive cues for an object’s identity.</p>
                    <p>Based on the previous studies mentioned above, in experiment 1, I explored which factors of robot surface texture are important to realize human-like skin and how it affects people’s acceptance of the robot by focusing on the roughness (smooth vs. rough) and the stiffness(soft vs. hard). In experiment 2, I compared visual and tactile human-robot interaction to see the effect of haptics on user acceptance of a robot.</p>

                    <p>I created interactive prototypes with four surface textures (smooth-soft, smooth-hard, rough-soft and rough-hard) using 3D printing, LittleBits and craft materials.</p>
                    <center><span class="image fit"><img src="images/haptic5.jpg" alt="", style="width:408px;height:418px;" /></span></center>
                    
                    <p>Four different textures of the robot surface were selected by physical roughness (smooth vs. rough) and stiffness (soft vs. hard): oil-based modeling clay (smooth-soft; A), plastic (smooth-hard; B), wiresponge (rough-soft; C) and stonespray (rough-hard; D). The four robots made sound feedback when participants touched its body. The robots were controlled by the Wizard of Oz technique.</p>
                    <center><span class="image fit"><img src="images/haptic6.jpg" alt="", style="width:626px;height:282px;" /></span></center>
                    <center><span class="image fit"><img src="images/haptic7.jpg" alt="", style="width:626px;height:284px;" /></span></center>
                    <center><span class="image fit"><img src="images/haptic8.jpg" alt="", style="width:626px;height:284px;" /></span></center>
                    <p>In experiment 1, participants had haptic interactions with the four robots by physical contact. The results showed that low level of physical roughness and stiffness of robot surface enhanced the social presence of a robot. Participants attributed the highest level of social presence to the robot with smooth-soft texture (clay) and the lowest level of social presence to the robot with rough-hard texture (stonespray). However, they showed different tendency in likeability and perceived safety of a robot. Participants preferred the robot with smooth-hard texture (plastic) the most, followed by smooth-soft texture (clay). In addition, we found that physical stiffness, which was recognized by the physical structure of materials, was dominant than the perception of roughness, which was recognized by surface shape pattern. The results of experiment 1 indicate that the nature of physical texture could be used as the way of regulating tactile anthropomorphism of a robot.</p>

                    <p>In experiment 2, the results showed a significant difference between visual interaction and tactile interaction considering likeability of a robot. Participants, who had haptic interaction with a robot in experiment 1, preferred hard surface than soft surface. On the contrary, participants, who had visual interaction without touch in experiment 2, preferred soft surface to hard surface.</p>
                    <center><span class="image fit"><img src="images/haptic10.jpg" alt="", style="width:455px;height:435px;" /></span></center>
                    <p>By comparing the result of experiment 1 and 2, the different user acceptances of a robot between haptic and visual interactions implies that tactile uncanny valley based on the integration of vision and touch would have a different trend with Mori’s uncanny valley. This study provides an initial basis for designers trying to modulate the level of tactile anthropomorphism of a robot by considering surface texture to design an acceptable social robot in haptic aspects.</p>
