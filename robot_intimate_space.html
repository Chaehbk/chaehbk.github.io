<h1>Robot in Your Intimate Space</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Can people allow a social robot to enter their intimate space?</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In our modern society, we can easily find social robots providing concierge, delivery, or security services in public spaces. These social robots are able to recognize people nearby and physically approach them using their mobility. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxemics">Hall (1963)</a>, "intimate space" is the region surrounding a person within 1.5 feet that they regard as psychologically theirs. Most people value their personal space and actively protect it. We may feel discomfort, anger, or anxiety when our personal space is invaded.</p>

<p>Permitting someone to enter our personal space—or entering someone else's—serves as an indicator of how we perceive our relationship with that person. Intimate space is typically reserved for close friends, lovers, children, or close family members. This raises an important question: <strong>How do people perceive and react to a social robot entering their intimate space?</strong></p>

<h2>Theoretical Background</h2>

<h3>Ontological Perspectives on Social Robots</h3>
<p>There are two conflicting ontological claims about social robots <span class="citation">(Searle et al., 2001)</span>:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Strong ontology:</strong> A robot could replace a human being with sufficiently advanced technology</li>
    <li><strong>Weak ontology:</strong> A robot could never replace a human being and remains fundamentally an artifact</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Dual Nature of Robots</h3>
<p>In the field of Human-Robot Interaction, Disalvo et al. (2002) argued that robots possess both <em>humanness</em> and <em>productness</em> characteristics:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>If humanness dominates:</strong> People develop substantive emotional engagement toward robots and perceive them as social beings. In this case, people may want to maintain distance from robots to preserve their intimate space, and may feel discomfort when robots enter their intimate zones.</li>
    
    <li><strong>If productness dominates:</strong> People do not develop substantive emotional engagement toward robots and perceive them as non-social beings. People may then allow robots to approach closely without experiencing discomfort when robots enter their intimate spaces.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Study Design</h2>
<p>To determine which characteristic dominates in human perception of robots, I compared human-robot interaction with human-human and human-product interactions.</p>

<p><strong>Design:</strong> Within-subjects experiment with 3 communicator types (human vs. robot vs. product), N=30 participants.</p>

<h3>Procedure</h3>
<p>Participants had physical contact with three communicators in randomized order. In each condition, participants were instructed to place their hands on the communicator's cheeks and lower their hands when they felt awkwardness or discomfort. After each condition, a questionnaire regarding the interaction was administered.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<h3>Perception Measures</h3>
<p>People perceived the robot as intermediate between the human and the product across multiple dimensions: social presence, anthropomorphism, animacy, and likeability.</p>

<h3>Physical Contact Duration</h3>
<div class="key-finding">
<strong>Key Finding:</strong> Participants maintained the longest physical contact with the robot—longer than with either the human or the product.
</div>

<p>According to post-experimental surveys and interviews, the findings reveal distinct patterns:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Human interaction:</strong> Participants regarded the interaction as a stranger's invasion of their personal space, leading to shorter contact duration.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Product interaction:</strong> Participants felt the least motivation to continue the interaction because they regarded the product as a non-social, non-living being with no interaction capability.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Robot interaction:</strong> Participants felt comfortable continuing the physical contact and believed they were engaged in two-way interaction. They perceived that the robot had a lower level of social presence than a human, but still regarded it as a social being capable of recognizing them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Discussion and Implications</h2>

<p>The results demonstrate that the robot's <em>humanness</em> enables it to engage in social interaction with people, while its <em>productness</em> reduces people's discomfort toward the robot even within intimate space. Since the robot's productness is perceived more dominantly than its humanness, people are able to maintain longer interactions with the robot than with a real person.</p>

<h3>Practical Implications</h3>
<p>These findings suggest two important applications:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Service robots:</strong> Robots may become excellent assistants for providing physical services to people in close proximity.</li>
    <li><strong>Healthcare and assistance:</strong> Robots could effectively provide physical assistance at very close distances without causing user discomfort—a valuable characteristic for eldercare, rehabilitation, and other assistance contexts.</li>
</ol>
