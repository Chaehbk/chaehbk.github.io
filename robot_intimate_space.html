                            <b>Can people allow a social robot to enter their intimate space?</b></p>
                            
                            <p>Edward T. Hall insisted that intimate space (within 1.5 feet) is reserved for close friends, lovers, children and close family members. People can have physical contacts such as embracing, touching or whispering in this area. I conducted an experimental study to see how people perceive and react to a social robot in their intimate space.</p>
							<p>There are two conflicting claims with ontological approach about a robot: strong ontology and weak ontology (Searle et al., 2001). The strong ontological claim is that a robot could replace a human being with advanced technology, whereas the weak ontological claim is that a robot could not replace a human being but remained as an artifact being.</p>
							<p>A robot has both characteristics of humanness and productness. If the robot has humanness dominantly, people could have substantive emotional engagement toward a robot and could perceive a robot as a social being. In this case, people could not allow the robot to enter their intimate space and feel discomfort of the robot’s invasion in intimate space. However, if the robot has productness dominantly, people could not have substantive emotional engagement toward a robot and perceive as a non-social being. Then people can allow the robot to get close to them and feel comfort of the robot’s approach.</p>

                            <p>To see the robot’s dominant characteristic, I compared human-robot interaction with human-human interaction and human-product interaction. 3 (communicator types: a human vs. a robot vs. a product) with-in participants experiment design was used(N=30).</p>
                            <p>Participants had physical contact with three communicators in random order. In each condition, participants were asked to put their hands on each communicator’s cheeks and lower their hands when they feel awkwardness or discomfort. After each condition, a questionnaire regarding the stimuli was administered.</p>
                            <center><span class="image fit"><img src="images/intimate3.png" alt="", style="width:660px;height:390px;"/></span></center>
                            <p>People perceived the robot in between the human and the product for social presence, anthropomorphism, animacy, and likeability. However, for the duration of physical contact in intimate space, people had longest physical contact with the robot. According to post-experimental interview, participants regarded the interaction with a human as a stranger’s invasion of their personal space. In the case of the interaction with the product, participants felt a bit boring and less motivated to continue the interaction. On the other hand, for the interaction with a robot, participants showed their curiosity toward a robot and continued interaction due to the robot’s interactivity.</p>
                            <p>The results show that humanness of a robot can induce social interaction, but productness of a robot lessen users’ discomfort toward a robot within their personal space. Also, productness is perceived as more dominantly than humanness, so people could have the longest interaction with a robot comparing a human and a product. The result indicates that people can make intimate and enjoyable interaction with the robot in the intimate distance. This implies that robot can be perceived as an interactive artifact being which has the lower social presence than a human.</p>
