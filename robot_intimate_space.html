							<h1>Robot in Your Intimate Space</h1><br />
                            <p style="font-size:17px"><b>Can people allow a social robot to enter their intimate space?</b></p>
                            <p>Nowadays, we can easily find social robots providing concierge, delivery or security services in public spaces. These social robots can recognize surrounding people and get closer distance between the people and themselves. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxemics">Hall(1963)</a> insisted that intimate space (within 1.5 feet) is reserved for close friends, lovers, children and close family members. People can have physical contacts such as embracing, touching or whispering in this area. Then how people perceive and react to a social robot in their intimate space?</p><br />

							<p><b>Related Study</b><br /><br />
                            There are two conflicting claims with ontological approach about social robots: strong ontology and weak ontology (Searle et al., 2001). The strong ontological claim is that a robot could replace a human being with advanced technology, whereas the weak ontological claim is that a robot could not replace a human being but remained as an artifact being.</p>
							<p>In the field of Human-Robot Interaction, Disalvo et al.(2002) insisted that robots have both characteristics of a robot, humanness and productness. If robots have humanness dominantly, people could have substantive emotional engagement toward robots and could perceive robots as social beings. In this case, people could not allow the robots to enter their intimate space and feel discomfort of the robots' invasion in intimate space. However, if robots has productness dominantly, people could not have substantive emotional engagement toward robots and perceive as non-social beings. Then people can allow the robots to get close with them and feel comfort of the robot’s approach.</p>
                            
                            <p><b>Study Design</b><br /><br />
                            To see the robot’s dominant characteristic, I compared human-robot interaction with human-human / human-product interaction.<br />3 (communicator types: a human vs. a robot vs. a product) with-in participants experiment design was used(N=30).</p>
                            
                            <p><b>Procedure</b><br/><br />
                            Participants had physical contact with three communicators in random order. In each condition, participants were asked to put their hands on each communicator’s cheeks and lower their hands when they feel awkwardness or discomfort. After each condition, a questionnaire regarding the stimuli was administered.</p>

                            <p><b>Results</b><br />
                            People perceived the robot in between the human and the product for social presence, anthropomorphism, animacy, and likeability. However, for the duration of physical contact in intimate space, participants had the longest physical contact with the robot. According to post-experimental interview, participants regarded the interaction with a human as a stranger’s invasion of their personal space. For the interaction with the product, participants felt a bit boring and less motivated to continue the interaction with the non-social and non-living thing. On the other hand, for the interaction with a robot, participants were interested in their interaction with the robot due to the robot's interactivity. Participants perceived that the robot had lower level of social presence than a human but still felt like the robot was conscious as a living being.</p>

                            <p>This results show that humanness of a robot can induce social interaction, but productness of a robot lessen people's discomfort toward a robot within personal space. Also, productness is perceived as more dominantly than humanness, so people could have the longest interaction with a robot comparing a human and a product. The result indicates that people can make enjoyable physical interaction with the robot in the intimate space. This implies that robot can be a great assistant which can provide its service in users' intimate space without causing discomfort.</p>
