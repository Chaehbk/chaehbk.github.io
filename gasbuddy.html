                                				<div class="Rtable-cell Rtable-cell-body">GasBuddy is a mobile crowdsourcing platform for sharing up-to-date local gas station prices. I have run mid-large scale user studies with design, marketing, and data science team.<br /><br />
                                                    <b>Study 1. User interviews with 4 types of GasBuddy users (N=32)</b><br />
                                                    Conducted user interviews combined with online surveys to get a better understanding of users' goals, behaviors, and desires. I had 32 participants(12 in-person/20 remote sessions) from urban, suburb, and rural area across the US. <br /><br />
                                                    <center><span class="image"><img src="images/gasbuddy2.png" alt=""/></span></center><br />
                                                    Participants were categorized into 4 different groups(Power users, casual users, New users, and Inactive users) by their GasBuddy usage patterns and periods. I asked users' driving habits and related GasBuddy experience to understand why they come back to GasBuddy, when/how they use our app, and what makes them satisfied or dissatisfied. Participants were also asked to rate their related GasBuddy experience on For you, Find gas, Win, and Wallet page in the mobile application.<br /><br />

                                                    <b>Study 2. GasBuddy payment (N=20)</b><br />
                                                    Currently, conducting user interviews combined with online surveys to see how Pay with GasBuddy users are using their mobile Wallet pages and physical debit cards.</br></br>
                                                    In the study 1, 16% of participants(5 out of 32, 4 female, 1 male) were Pay w/ GB users and they scored 4.4 out of 5 on average for their Wallet page experience. However, most participants who haven't used Pay w/ GB(84%, 27 out of 32) said the advertisement on the first page of the Wallet menu wasn't clear enough to understand and it made barriers to sign up for Pay w/ GB. Non-users were also confused Pay w/ GB with a mobile pay or a credit card reward program.<br><br>
                                                    To get more details of user contexts of P w/ GB, I will have total 20 participants(12 Pay w/ GB users + 8 non Pay w/ GB users) to learn their fuel-purchasing habits and related GasBuddy experience.</br></br>
