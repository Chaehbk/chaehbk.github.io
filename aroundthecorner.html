                                                    <p>Around The Corner started as a hobby in 2023: every week after the pandemic, I met two strangers for coffee. I found them through anonymous writing on social media, and in just three months there were 150+ people on the waitlist.</p>
														
													<p>I realized this shouldn’t be limited to 1:1 coffees with me. It could be a platform where people discover each other through their stories. I spun up the first version with Google Forms and Sheets, then in 2024 invited one of those strangers to join as my technical co-founder. Together, we launched our first website in January 2024.</p>

													<p>By September 2025, Around The Corner had grown organically to 2,500+ users across California with 38% three-month retention. We partnered with five hospitality and F&B businesses, ran 30+ group events, and most of them sold out with ~93% attendance and very low no-show rates. We’d validated product–user fit, but hit the limits of our initial platform design to reach true product–market fit and extend our runway.</p>

													<p>In September 2025, we made the hard decision to wind down that version of the product and rebuild Around The Corner from scratch.</p>

													<div class="Rtable-cell Rtable-cell-body">
														<p>The first version of Around The Corner was a writing-first community where people introduced themselves through their lived experiences and turned those stories into in-person coffee chats in their city.</p>
															
														<p>New members joined through an application with five long-form prompts. Each prompt was designed to help people describe who they are through experiences rather than labels—no self-staged photos, and no focus on age, gender, job title, or ethnicity. Profiles allowed one faceless photo that captured an everyday moment or something personally meaningful.</p>
	
														<center><span class="image main"><img src="images/aroundthecorner2.svg" alt=""/></span></center>
	
														<p>Once accepted, members could deepen their profiles through ongoing journaling. Using their writing, we used AI to generate thoughtful follow-up questions that helped them expand their stories. We built the journaling experience using GPT-3.5 and Claude Sonnet 4.</p>

														<p>We also hosted monthly gatherings—Silent Reading Parties, coffee tastings, and other small events—to bring the community together offline. To explore B2B opportunities, we partnered with five local hospitality and F&B businesses across the SF Bay Area, Greater Los Angeles, and Orange County.</p>
