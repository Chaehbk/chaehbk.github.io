                                                    <p>Around The Corner was born in 2024 from my hobby project started one year before.</p>
														
													<p>After pandemic, I had a hobby project meeting two strangers every week over coffee. I found strangers through my anonymous writing on social media. Soon after 3 months, my project went viral to have 150+ people on the waitlist. I thought this should be a platform where people can discover each other beyond 1:1 with me, and introduced the early concept of the community using Google Form and Sheet. In the same year, I invited one of the strangers to be my technical co-founder and we launched our first website in January 2024.</p>

													<p>Fast forward to September 2025, Around The Corner grew to serve 2500+ users across California organically and achieved 38% 3-month user retention. We partnered with 5 hospitality and F&B businesses to test B2B opportunities and hosted 30+ group events. Majority of our events were sold out with 93+ participation rate and extremly low no-shows. Although we successfully validated the product-user fit, we faced the limitation of the platform design to achieve the product-market fit and extend our runway. In September 2025, we decided to wind down the platform and rebuild Around The Corner from scratch.</p>

													<div class="Rtable-cell Rtable-cell-body">
														<p>Around The Corner users used their lived experience to introduce themselves and turn them into new connections that lead to IRL coffee chats in town.</p>
															
														<p>Around The Corner accepted users through our application process where they answer to five long-form writing prompts we provided. The five prompts were carefully crafted to allow users introduce themselves based on their lived experiences, not using self-staged photos or superficial information such as age, sex, job, or ethnicity. Our platform only allowed one faceless photo describing their everyday life or their recent speical moments.</p>

														<p>Around The Corner allowed users to add more depth to their profile through journaling. Based on those approved users' long-form writings, we used AI to generate follow-up questions to help users deepen their stories. GPT-3.5 and Claude Sonnet 4 were used for AI-guided journaling experience.</p>

														<p>Around The Corner also hosted monthly gatherings to offer community experiences in real life. We partnered with 5 local hospitality and F&B businesses in SF Bay Area, Greater Los Angeles, and Orange County area to explore B2B partnership opportunities.</p>
