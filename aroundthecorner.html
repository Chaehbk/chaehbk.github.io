                                                    <p>Around The Corner was born in 2024 from my hobby project started one year before.</p>
														
													<p>After pandemic, I had a hobby project meeting two strangers every week over coffee. I found strangers through my anonymous writing on social media. Soon after 3 months, my project went viral to have 150+ people on the waitlist. I thought this should be a platform where people can discover each other beyond 1:1 with me, and introduced the early concept of the community using Google Form and Sheet. In the same year, I invited one of the strangers to be my co-founder and we launched our first website in January 2024.</p>

													<p>Fast forward to September 2025, Around The Corner grew to serve 2500+ users across California organically and achieved 38% 3-month user retention. We partnered with 5 hospitality and F&B businesses to test B2B opportunities and hosted 30+ group events. Majority of our events were sold out with 93+ participation rate and extremly low no-shows.</p>

													<p>Although we successfully validated the product-user fit, we faced the limitation of the platform design to achieve the product-market fit and extend our runway. In September 2025, we decided to rebuild Around The Corner from scratch.</p>

													<p>Around The Corner currently has one co-founder seat open to whom are familiar with web-mobile hybrid platform and willing to experiment with AI creative writing. Come check out our latest update: <a href="https://www.aroundthecorner.today">www.aroundthecorner.today</a></p>
