                            <div class="Rtable-cell Rtable-cell-body"><p>ID Lab in Ewha Womans University developed STEAM education program "Building Smart Birdhouse" for elementary schools that encourage eco-friendly learning activities in urban areas. This program aims to learn enviromental issues of birds habitat in urban area and let students have a chance to design possible solutions using technology.</p>

                                <p>STEAM is an educational approach to learning that uses <u>S</u>cience, <u>T</u>echnology, <u>E</u>ngineering, the <u>A</u>rts and <u>M</u>athematics as access points for guiding student inquiry, dialogue, and critical thinking. ID Lab proposed a 4-subject integrated education program based on 3rd-4th grade curriculums of science I, science II, mathematics, and art. This education program had developed through 8-month research. The 8-week pilot program was conducted for usability testing at Imae Elementary School with 2 teachers and 34 students.</p>

                                One-semester long curriculum and 8-week pilot program was developed based on the contents from the four regular subjects(Science I and II, Math, Art).<br />
                                My team reviewed 3rd and 4th grade curriculums including textbooks and teaching material from 5 different publishers with elementary school teachers.<br /></p>

				    <p><b>Creating mockup and testing interactive prototytpe:</b><br />
                                I developed interactive prototypes using cardboards with circuit boards, electronic sensors and modules.

                                Students learn urban environmental issues and understand the problem of bird habitats.<br />

                                Students learn basic principles of electronic devices and make Smart Birdhouses<br />

                                Students set up Smart Birdhouses, write obervation diary and track the number of birds' visits<br />
                                *One additional ordinary birdhouse was installed to compare with the smart birdhouse<br />

                                    <p>28 out of 34 students were satisfied or very satisfied with our 6-week pilot program.</p>
                                    <p>The satisfaction survey showed that students enjoyed the process of indentifying problems of their environments and suggesting solutions to solve the issues. Especially, most students felt feeling of success and achievement after applying their own solutions and getting hands-on experience of positive environmental changes made by themselves.</p>
                                    <p>Another interesting feedback was that, outdoor group activities motivated students to make active discussions and set their own additional rules, which were very helpful for teachers to lead and manage the classes. To get more live tracking data, students proactively increased the number of daily observation from 2 times(9AM/3PM) to 3 times(9AM/12:30PM/3PM) and decided to take turns coming to school 20 minutes earlier to watch the birdhouses.</p>
