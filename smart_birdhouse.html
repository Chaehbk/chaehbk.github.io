                            <div class="Rtable-cell Rtable-cell-body"><p>ID Lab in Ewha Womans University developed STEAM education program "Building Smart Birdhouse" for elementary schools that encourage outdoor activities in urban areas. This program aims to learn enviromental issues of birds habitat in urban area and let students have a chance to design possible solutions using technology.</p>
                                <p>STEAM is an educational approach to learning that uses <u>S</u>cience, <u>T</u>echnology, <u>E</u>ngineering, <u>A</u>rts and <u>M</u>athematics as access points for guiding student inquiry, dialogue, and critical thinking. ID Lab proposed a 4-subject integrated education program based on 3rd-4th grade curriculums of science I, science II, mathematics, and art. This education program had developed through 8-month research. The 8-week pilot program was conducted for usability testing at Imae Elementary School with 2 teachers and 34 students.</p></br>

                                <p>Students made the birdhouses using cardboards and various craft materials. To help students see how many times birds visited, we provide them a light sensor, small CPU, and flexible numerical display screen. The light sensor was located right under the birdhouse entrance, so it detected birds’ visit when the bird block the light on the sensor while passing through the hole. Then small CPU calculated the total number of light blocking and the number is shown up on the FND display. Students can get the net number of the birds' visit by dividing total number in half.<p>

                                One-semester long curriculum and 8-week pilot program was developed based on the contents from the four regular subjects(Science I and II, Math, Art).<br />
                                My team reviewed 3rd and 4th grade curriculums including textbooks and teaching material from 5 different publishers with elementary school teachers.<br /></p>

                                I developed interactive prototypes using cardboards with circuit boards, electronic sensors and modules.

                                    <p>28 out of 34 students answered that they were satisfied or very satisfied with our 6-week pilot program.</p>
                                    <p>Students' self-satisfaction was a great reward to motivate them to participate in the activities. They enjoyed watching how their idea affected the real environment and getting hands-on experience relating to what they learned from the textbooks. Outdoor group activities generated students' group discussion as well. Students set their own rules and took turns to watch the birdhouse 3 times(9AM/12:30PM/3PM) in a day.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Teachers also said they were glad to find an education curriculum with outdoor activities that have many intersections with their regular subjects. So teachers felt comfortable with running the program and didn’t have to set aside a long time to prepare the classes because most of the contents were extracted from their textbooks following the order of the chapters. In addition, teachers said that students' positive feedbacks also affected their parents' satisfaction of their kids' education.</p>
