							<p>A field study of STEAM education development</p>
                            
							<p>ID Lab in Ewha Womans University developed STEAM education curriculum and conducted its 6-week pilot program with 2 teachers and 30 students at Imae Elementary School. STEAM is an educational approach to learning that uses Science, Technology, Engineering, <u>the Arts</u> and Mathematics as access points for guiding student inquiry, dialogue, and critical thinking. ID Lab suggested an 4-subject integrated education program including outdoor activities based on 3rd-4th grade Science I, Science II, Mathematics, and Art curriculums.</p>
                            
							<p>The smart birdhouse is made with corrugated cardboard with various craft materials. It contains a light sensor and a flexible numeric display screen inside to let the students monitor the birds’ visits. When the birds enter through the round hole on the front side, the light sensor(in-put) is overshadowed and flexible numeric display screen(out-put) prints the number of the birds’ visits. Two-week field trial with 2 teachers and 34 students was conducted to evaluate the education program.</p>
                            
                            <p>The curriculum includes 6 sessions. In the session 1 and 2, students learn about the birds habitat in the urban environment, and how the electronic appliances are working with in-put and out-put devices. Students can understand how the smart birdhouse works with a light sensor and a flexible numeric display.</p>
