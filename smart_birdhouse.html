                            <div class="Rtable-cell Rtable-cell-body"><p>ID Lab in Ewha Womans University developed STEAM education program "Building Smart Birdhouse" for elementary schools that encourage eco-friendly learning activities in urban areas. This program aims to learn enviromental issues of birds habitat in urban area and let students have a chance to design possible solutions using technology.</p>
<p>STEAM is an educational approach to learning that uses <u>S</u>cience, <u>T</u>echnology, <u>E</u>ngineering, the <u>A</u>rts and <u>M</u>athematics as access points for guiding student inquiry, dialogue, and critical thinking. ID Lab suggested a 4-subject integrated education program based on 3rd-4th grade curriculums of science I, science II, mathematics, and art. This education program had developed through 8-month research and 6-week pilot program was condcuted for usability testing at Imae Elementary School with 2 teachers and 34 students.</p>

                                6-week curriculm was developed based on 4 subjects(Science I and II, Math, Art).<br />
                                My team reviewed 3rd and 4th grade curriculums and 14 textbooks to extract teaching and learning contects.<br /></p>

                                    <p>82.4 percent of students were satisfied or very satisfied with our 6-week pilot program.<br />Also, students evaluated Smart birdhouse more positively and intelligent than the ordinary birdhouse.</p>
                                    <p>As a result of the satisfaction survey, students enjoyed the process of indentifying problems and suggesting solutions. Expecially, they had feeling of success and achievement when executing their own solutions and experiencing environmental changes made by themselves.</p>
                                    <p>One more interesting point was, teachers said that program motivated students to make active discussions, set their own rules and volunteered themselves for additional group activities. Students voluntarily increased the number of daily observation from 2 times(9AM/3PM) to 3 times(9AM/12:30PM/3PM) and decided to take turns coming to school 20 minutes earlier to watch the birdhouses.</p>
