                            <h3>Summary</h3>
							<p>ID Lab in Ewha Womans University developed STEAM education program "Building Smart Birdhouse" for elementary schools that encourage eco-friendly learning activities in urban areas. This program aims to learn enviromental issues of birds habitat in urban area and let students have a chance to design possible solutions using technology.</p>
                            <p>STEAM is an educational approach to learning that uses <u>S</u>cience, <u>T</u>echnology, <u>E</u>ngineering, the <u>A</u>rts and <u>M</u>athematics as access points for guiding student inquiry, dialogue, and critical thinking. ID Lab suggested a 4-subject integrated education program based on 3rd-4th grade curriculums of science I, science II, mathematics, and art. This education program had developed through 8-month research and 6-week pilot program was condcuted for usability testing at Imae Elementary School with 2 teachers and 34 students.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Role</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Identified research topic and designed study that address user behaviors and attitudes</li>
                                <li>Conducted usablity testing using a wide variety of qualitative methods and a subset of quantitative
                                    methods</li>
                                <li>Designed and launched surveys and conducted statistical analysis</li>
                                <li>Worked cross-functionally with design, engineering, and project management</li>
                            </ul>
                       
                            <h3>Methods</h3>
							<ul>
                                <li>Mockup testing and interactive prototyping</li>
                                <li>Qualitative: field study, diary study and Interviewing </li>
                                <li>Quantitiative: questionnares and post-experimental surveys</li>
                                <li>T-test(stastical analysis)</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <h3>Procedure</h3>
                            <p>Developing curriculum:<br />
                            6-week curriculm was developed based on 4 subjects(Science I and II, Math, Art).<br />
                            We reviewed 3rd and 4th grade curriculums and 14 textbooks to extract teaching and learning contects.</p>
                            <p>Creating and testing mockup and interactive prototytpe:<br />
                            Cardboard mockup<br />
                            Interactive prototypes with circuit boards, electronic sensors and modules</p>
                            <p>Field study:<br />
                            Week 1 <br />
                            Week 2 <br />
                            Week 3 <br />
                            Week 4 <br />
                            Week 5 <br />
                            Week 6-7 <br />
                            Week 8 <br /></p>
                            
                            <h3>Results and Findings</h3>
                            <p>82.4 percent of students were satisfied or very satisfied with our 6-week pilot program. As a result of the survey, students enjoyed the process of indentifying problems and suggesting solutions. Expecially, they had feeling of success and achievement when executing their own solutions and experiencing environmental changes made by themselves.<br />
                            <p>One more interesting point was, teachers said that students in this program made active discussions, set their own rules and volunteered themselves for additional group activities. Students voluntarily increased the number of daily observation from 2 times(8:30AM/3:30PM) to 3 times(8:30AM/12:30PM/3:30PM) and decided to take turns coming to school 20 minutes earlier to watch the birdhouses.</p>
