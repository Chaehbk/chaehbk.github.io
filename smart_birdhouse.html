                            <h3>Summary</h3>
							<p>ID Lab in Ewha Womans University developed STEAM education program for elementary schools that encourage eco-friendly learning activities in urban areas. STEAM is an educational approach to learning that uses <u>S</u>cience, <u>T</u>echnology, <u>E</u>ngineering, the <u>A</u>rts and <u>M</u>athematics as access points for guiding student inquiry, dialogue, and critical thinking. ID Lab suggested a 4-subject integrated education program based on 3rd-4th grade curriculums of science I, science II, mathematics, and art. This education program had developed through 8-month research and 6-week pilot program was condcuted for usability testing at Imae Elementary School with 2 teachers and 30 students.</p>
