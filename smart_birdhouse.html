                                <p>Urban development in Seoul has dramatically reduced natural habitats, displacing bird populations and disconnecting children from nature. While elementary science curricula include environmental education, most lessons remain abstract and classroom-bound—students learn about ecosystems from textbooks without experiencing them firsthand.</p>

                                <p>Our team at ID Lab identified an opportunity: <b>What if we could teach environmental science through hands-on technology projects that allow students to become active participants in urban ecology?</b></p>

                                <p>The challenge was designing an educational program that would:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Make environmental issues tangible and personally relevant to 8-10 year olds</li>
                                    <li>Integrate seamlessly with existing school curricula (to encourage adoption)</li>
                                    <li>Introduce basic technology concepts in an accessible, non-intimidating way</li>
                                    <li>Create lasting behavior change beyond the classroom</li>

This was essential because children often struggle to articulate their learning experiences—observation and behavioral evidence proved more reliable than self-reported data alone.

                                    Students designed and constructed their birdhouses using cardboard, craft materials, and electronic components. Building on electric circuit concepts from science class, they connected light sensors (input) to the CPU and FND display (output), applying if/then conditional logic learned earlier. They troubleshot sensor placement and circuit connections through trial and error.<br />

                                    <p>Beyond measuring satisfaction, my research uncovered specific behavioral patterns and design implications for technology-enabled environmental education:</p>

                                    <p><b>Quantifiable data dramatically increased engagement duration</b><br>
                                        Students spent 2.7x longer observing birdhouses with sensors (average 12 minutes per recess) compared to the control birdhouse (4 minutes). The ability to collect "official" numerical data made outdoor observation feel purposeful rather than passive. This suggests gamification through measurement—not points or badges—drives intrinsic motivation in this age group.
                                        </p>

                                    <p><b>Curriculum alignment was the primary teacher adoption driver, not innovation</b><br>
                                        In teacher interviews, 100% (2/2) cited "alignment with existing textbook chapters" as the most important program feature. Teachers are constrained by standardized curricula and hesitant to adopt programs requiring extra preparation. Design implication: Educational technology must fit within existing workflows, not replace them.
                                    </p>

                                    <p><b>Ownership transformed students from observers to stewards</b><br>
                                        Students referred to birdhouses using possessive language ("my birdhouse," "our birds") and voluntarily checked sensor readings during free time. Three students even requested to take their birdhouses home after the program ended. This sense of ownership—built through the design and assembly process—appears critical for lasting environmental awareness.
                                    </p>

                                    <p><b>Technical complexity needed careful scaffolding</b><br>
                                        Initial prototypes assumed students could follow written assembly instructions. Observations revealed that 65% of students struggled with wire connections and sensor orientation until we introduced color-coded components and peer mentoring. This informed our final instruction design, which relied heavily on visual diagrams and buddy systems.
                                    </p>

                                    <p><b>Outdoor, hands-on activities amplified collaborative learning</b><br>
                                        Group interview data showed students valued "working together outside" as their favorite program aspect (mentioned by 29/34 students unprompted). Teacher observations confirmed that students who rarely participated in classroom discussions took leadership roles during outdoor installation. Context matters: physical making in non-traditional spaces may lower social barriers for some learners.

                                    <p>Beyond immediate program outcomes, we observed sustained behavioral changes that extended outside the structured curriculum. Nine students reported continuing to observe birds during weekends, and five students asked their parents to install birdhouses at home. Teachers noted increased volunteerism for outdoor cleanup activities in the weeks following the program, suggesting the experience fostered genuine environmental stewardship rather than temporary engagement.</p>

                                    <p>Both participating teachers expressed strong interest in continuing the program in future semesters, citing two primary factors: the program's alignment with existing curriculum standards meant minimal additional preparation time, and the visible student enthusiasm made the extra effort worthwhile. Since program content followed the natural progression of textbook chapters across Science, Math, and Art, teachers could reinforce regular classroom lessons while offering enriching hands-on experiences.</p>
