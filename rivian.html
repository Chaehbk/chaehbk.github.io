                                                    Fleet OS is a Rivian Fleet management software for commercial electric vehicles. Fleet OS enables fleet managers to operate a safe, cost-effective fleet with ease. It provides tools and dashboards to administer vehicle health, performance, service, charging, and utilization of fleets. <br /><br />
													I've been providing longitudinal UX research efforts along the product roadmap. I joined the team at the early stage of the product design and introduced a research framework for Fleet OS Amazon deployment.<br /><br />

													Fleet OS has been deployed to Amazon test site in August 2022. As the product gets the end users on board for the first time, the team is working on product enhancement to enhance quality of experience.<br /><br />
