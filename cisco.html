We are working on a VR-based problem-based learning experience that can complement traditional online learning environment.</p>
                                                    
                                                    <p>I'm the first user experience researcher in Cisco Learning Engineering. As a UXR, I'm leading UX discussions by conducting the various types of design researches along the product development cycle.</p>

                                                    <p>We are building a 3D immersive problem-based learning environment in VR based on industry settings. My team believes hands-on exercise is critical for picking up hands-on skills for entry-level network engineers especially for beginner levels and entry-level engineers who have less or no industry experience. In Cisco NetAcad VR, learners would encounter real-life networking problems in the virtual data center and they are tasked to identify and troubleshoot problems.</p>
                                                    <p>I've been a lead UXR for Cisco NetAcad VR and Cisco VR certification exam. I'm working on iterative design research on 3D immersive learning experiences along the product development cycle.</p>
