My team envisions next-generation learning for Cisco Networking Academy, a global IT-networking education program.</p>

                                                    Cisco is trying to create a 3D immersive problem-based learning experience in real-life settings to complement traditional 2D education/training environments. In Cisco NetAcad VR, users encounter real-life networking problem that they need to solve and they troubleshoot the problems as networking engineers would do in reality.<br /><br />
                                                    I'm a lead UXR for Cisco NetAcad VR and Cisco VR certification exam. I set up a research framework for the team and lead iterative design research on 3D immersive experience for online training and summative assessment.<br /><br />
                                                       The video below is a demo for Cisco VR certification exam that was presented at Cisco Live 2019, San Diego.</p>

                                                    I'm also leading user experience design and research works on rapid prototyping. After COVID-19, Cisco Networking Academy invests more in improving online teaching and learning experience. My team has a small group of learning scientists and software engineers experimenting with creative ideas to improve the quality of distance learning. I've been leading the user experiene design on  problem-based learning, game-based learning, adaptive learning sequence design, etc.  <br /></br />
