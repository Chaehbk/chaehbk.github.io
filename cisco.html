                                                    <p>Cisco Learning Scinece team is trying to bring more realistic problem-based learning experience that can complement traditional 2D screen-based learning. My team envisions the next-generation learning experience of Cisco Networking Academy, a global IT-networking education program.</p>
                                                    
                                                    <p>I'm the first user experience researcher in Cisco Learning Science. As a UXR, I'm leading UX discussions by conducting the various types of design researches along the product development cycle.</p>

                                                    <p><b>Project 1. Problem-based Learning in 3D VR Space</b></p>
                                                    <p>Cisco is trying to create a 3D immersive problem-based learning experience in VR based on real-life settings. My team believes hands-on learning is critical to teach and learn hands-on skills, especially for entry-level engineers with less experience in industry settings. In Cisco NetAcad VR, users encounter real-life networking problems in a data center that they need to solve using their hands and they troubleshoot the identified problems as IT-network enginnering professionals.</p>
                                                    <p>I'm a lead UXR for Cisco NetAcad VR and Cisco VR-based certification exam. I set up a research framework for the team and lead iterative design research on 3D immersive learning experience for online training and summative assessment.</p>

                                                    <p>After COVID-19, Cisco Networking Academy invests more in improving online distance learning experience. Rapid prototyping group is actively working on improving Packet Tracer, a 2D visual simulation software for IT-networking, so instructors and learners can get more practical 2D simulating experience based on real-life scenarios.</p>
                                                    <p>My team has a small rapid prototyping group to experiment various product ideas of distance learning. For radid prototyping, I'm responsible for taking care of user experience and creating design mockups.</p>
                                                    <p>Prototyping work mostly runs on the 2-week sprint to turn an early product idea to a minimum viable product. Once we get the experiment outcome at the end of the sprint, we set a larger group meeting with various stakeholders to demonstrate our idea and make a product decision. Once the team decides to continue the work to productize the idea, my team expands the prototyping work and starts working with production team to make it happen.</p>
