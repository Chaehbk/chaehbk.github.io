                    <p>I conducted usability testing, a mobile family locator as a sole UX researcher in design team. The purpose of the study was to test their swipe-through tutorial for the new premium plan and see if the tutorial helps users understand Life360's new features and how it influences on users' perchase decisions.</p>
                    <p>I used qualitative-quantitative mixed method and conducted in-person sessions with 24 participants for 3 different user groups(parent-mom, parent-dad, and Kids) in South Bay Area.
